* Added TiddlyWiki's [[Markdown|$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/markdown]] plugin to format OpenAI API responses
* API now uses the current conversation context to give responses
** Previously a "conversation" was one prompt and one response
** ''Note:'' Conversations are still bugged, API is not reading first user prompt when it is sent
* Added TiddlyWiki's [[Dynannotate|$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/dynannotate]] plugin to reformat how annotations are created and handled
* Fixed bug where annotation container was showing `wheat` color when no annotation existed
