title: ChatArchivist 0.88
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Updates in [[ChatArchivist 0.88]]
<hr>

# API conversation is no longer one prompt behind
# ``Annotation`` tag is now ``chatgptannotation``
# Updated [[Delete Current Conversations]]
## UI is now more alerting
## Current system prompt is no longer deleted
# Added [[API Key Setting]] to [[Settings]]
## Currently not functional
## In the future, the [[password widget|https://tiddlywiki.com/#PasswordWidget]] will encrypt API keys
# Updated [[select message macro|selectMessage]] so that the principle of provenance of archived objects is not violated
## Selecting a message tags a hidden tiddler titled ``$:/chatarchivist/(message title)-selected`` to save the state of the checkbox
## The hidden tiddler is deleted upon deselecting the message
# Changed ``<% if [title[System-$(conv_id)$]]%>`` to ``<% if [title![System-$(conv_id)$]]%>`` in [[$:/chatarchivist/startup/OpenAIAPI/systemPrompt]]
## This should eliminate the issue of multiple system prompts appearing on startup
# OpenAI API models changed in [[API Macro]]
## openaiTextGenerate() now uses ''gpt-4o-mini''
## archiveChat() now uses ''gpt-3.5-turbo''
# Removed all mention of Superpower-GPT browser extension

<hr>
''Scrapped Ideas''

#Drop down box to select from previously written system prompts
## //System prompts are now written per conversation, and saved to archived conversations//
## //Use for pre-writing system prompts seems trivial, unnecessarily code-heavy, and creates poor UX//
# Dynnannotate plugin removed
## //Provides a functionality we have already created ourselves//
## //Creates an ugly red highlight when using the global search bar//
<hr>
''Known bugs''

# Two story mode is covered by the sidebar on some machines
# OpenAI Import Python currently not working (should be fixed, needs to be tested)
